# Card

[Basic card](#basic-card) | [Alternate style](#alternate-style) | [Colour options](#colour-options) | [Complex example](#complex-example) | [Properties](#properties)

Example of basic, alternative and complex cards. Child elements can be anything, plain text, graphs, or other components. Subtitles, icons, change values, coloured borders are all optional, not mandatory.

If your UI is split into different areas or sections you can also choose to colour code your cards to match, by applying a colour prop which adds the corresponding colour as a top border.

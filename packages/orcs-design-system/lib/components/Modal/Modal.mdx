# Modal

[Properties](#properties)

The `Modal` component brings up a popup container upon clicking on a `Button` that changes the `visible` property of the `Modal` to `true`.

This is a blank slate and functions to close the `Modal` and take any action must be specified (including any `Button` elements contained in the popup). The only element included by default is the close icon `X` on the upper right corner, which fires the `onClose` function when it is clicked.

For a special case of this component that has Confirm and Cancel functionality baked in, see [Dialogue](./?path=/docs/components-dialogue--basic).

# Modal

[Properties](#properties)

The `Modal` component brings up a popup container upon clicking on a `Button` that changes the `visible` property of the `Modal` to `true`.

This is a blank slate and functions to close the `Modal` and take any action must be specified (including any `Button` elements contained in the popup). The only element included by default is the close icon `X` on the upper right corner, whose `onClose` function **must** be specified. The event listener to enable closing upon clicking outside `Modal` needs to be specified as well.

**Note:** the `id` for both the overlay and the container must be unique (see the props table below) to allow for multiple `Modal` components to be used in the same screen.

For a special case of this that has Confirm and Cancel functionality baked in, see [Dialogue](./?path=/docs/components-dialogue--basic).
